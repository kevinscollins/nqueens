# Exploration of the [N-Queens Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) in Python

## Instructions 

> These are the different aspect of the project you can work on (in order):
> 1. determine all possible solutions for a given N where N â‰¥ 8 (within 10 mins on a laptop). Bonus points for a higher N where N is the size of the board / number of queens
> 2. iterate over N and store the solutions in postgres using SQLAlchemy
> 3. write basic tests that at least verify the number of solutions for a given N match what's online. I recommend using pytest
> 4. Docker-ize the solution, so that I can run the code and tests without any assumption of my local setup (including running a postgres instance in docker-compose)
> 5. setup Travis CI (or similar) for your public GitHub repo to run the tests automatically
>
> You don't need to go through all of the steps, but there should be instructions on how I can run the code. I mainly want to see how you approach a problem and your coding style. There are multiple steps so you have the option to show me different skills. It's up to you.
>
> Please commit everything in a public GitHub repo and use python3.
>
> You can borrow from an existing solutionâ€”except for Google's. If you borrow from someone else's code, please cite where you got the code and be ready to explain how the code works.

## Run it!

The [master branch](https://github.com/kevinscollins/nqueens) has all 5 of these implemented and can be cloned and then should be runnable
with a recent/compatible Docker installation.

### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/kevinscollins/nqueens && cd nqueens`

### Build Docker containers and Start Database

`docker-compose up -d`

### Classic 8-Queens Computation

`docker-compose run app python nqueens 8`

### Run Tests

`docker-compose run app pytest nqueens`

## Algorithmic Exploration

I implemented Greg Trowbridge's ["A Bitwise Solution to the N Queens Problem in JavaScript"](http://gregtrowbridge.com/a-bitwise-solution-to-the-n-queens-problem-in-javascript/)
in python, and upgraded it with Joyce Liu's ["Using Symmetry to Optimize an N-Queens Counting Algorithm"](http://liujoycec.github.io/2015/09/20/n_queens_symmetry/). 

I believe both of these approaches are parallizable, by separating out each column of the first row into separate recursive processes, 
but did not get this successfully working in a short period of time, see [wip_multiprocessing](https://github.com/kevinscollins/nqueens/tree/wip_multiprocessing).

## Performance

On my 2016 Macbook Pro, I can run N = 14 in 48 seconds of "wall clock" time, including container startup and overhead, etc. For N = 15, it takes right around 10 minutes.
For comparison, Joyce Liu's JavaScript algorithm completes N = 16 in about 8 seconds ðŸ˜³ - althought it doesn't save, or even store, the solutions.

I profiled it with cProfile and the majority of the time is getting used with bitwise operations. There are other functions that could be improved for incremental speedup.

I did not realize how slow python's bitwise operations are and might have approached this problem differently if I had. Short of implementing the recursive logic natively, 
I did not find a good way to get native-esque bit operation performance in python.
